# creaticat
Premise: the stray neighborhood cat (thatâ€™s actually a deity) for your discord server. All members on the server can interact with it, and it does various things. Keeps servers alive and helps promote community engagement!

The final version of the project and its code is called CreatiCat 2.6

A few of the commands are listed below:

.setPrefix <prefix> - Change the prefix for using the bot
.setName <name> - Name your cat!

.pray - You can pray to me (I am a god after all... or, used to be...)
.pet - You can pet me (be nice tho... I'm watching you...)
.tribute - Gimme money (I need it for the catnip, I am still a cat y'know? | _resets once a day_)
.boop - Risk your fingers :)
.hello - Say "hi" to our local god

.info - Check up on me!
.invite - Invite me to other servers (I need more followers~)
